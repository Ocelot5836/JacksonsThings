# The Great Wiki

## Getting Started
So, I hear you want to help contribute to the Great Wiki! That's Great! Let's get started.



First, you're going to want to fork the GitWub-Sites repo. (https://github.com/MrCrayfish/GitWeb-Sites)
Second, now that you forked GitWeb-Sites you can start creating! In your forked copy of GitWeb-Sites, go into the "official" folder then go into the "thegreatwiki" folder.
Once you go into those folders you can then go to the pages folder, then a wiki of your choice! Go into either Device-Mod or Minecraft to create your page.

## Creating
Now that you have gone into the folders, create a folder of what you want the page to be called, then create a .txt file inside it called "index.txt". Once that is done, you can then create your page.

## Format
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! If you do not follow this, your site will be declined immediately.
